    npm init -y to generate the package.json
    Dockerfile with alpine for the container
    make sure to add  "start":"node app.js" to package.json
    run locally then use $docker build . to make container
    test docker container by running #docker run -it -p 80:80 [longnumber from  the previos step] (-p 80:80 will map the exposed port)
